# Bonjour ! Hello ! Hallo !ðŸ‘‹

## I am Olivia.

:woman_technologist: I am a Belgian Front-End flavored Web Developer and Photographer living in Nantes.

ðŸ”­ Beside that, I am working on my personal portfolio at [Palingenae / palingenae.be](https://github.com/Palingenae/palingenae.be). There is also a list of my projects with my design tokens on [palingenae.github.io](https://palingenae.github.io).

ðŸŽ“ I am graduating at [@OpenClassrooms](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms) where I am learning again Back-End development with Symfony and Docker. Now I am working on the final technical project from the cursus, [**Project 8 : ToDo&Co**](https://github.com/Palingenae/OC-P8-Todo-Co). **The cursus is on hold, so is the latter project.**
